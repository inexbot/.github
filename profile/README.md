iNexBot is dedicated to the research and development of multi-axis motion control technology and the application and promotion of industry solutions. Its core technologies include PLCopen-based multi-axis motion control, robot kinematics, dynamics algorithms, multi-intelligent body control, reinforcement learning, online trajectory planning, visual hand-eye calibration technology, 3D vision, force control, etc. Currently, its main products cover industrial robots, collaborative robots, medical surgery robots, wafer robots, automotive electronics and many other fields.

iNexBot's core product, industrial robot motion control system, has been widely used in China's industrial robot industry, with cumulative sales of over 10,000 units, which are used in a variety of industrial scenarios such as welding, stamping, palletizing and painting.

iNexBot's self-developed open NexDroid software system can provide a stable, reliable and feature-rich secondary development interface (NexDroid API). NexDroid shields the hardware device layer and application layer, allowing partners to focus only on industry needs. Using NexDroid API, combined with industry experience, they can develop new automation equipment, such as medical, nuclear, construction machinery, wind power and other industry equipment.

Now iNexBot has grown into an excellent partner in China's motion control industry, with services covering industry leaders such as Foxconn, BYD, Hikrobot, Huawei, WingTech, Qichuang, Moka, and Tamasec.

With more than 60 R&D engineers located in Nanjing and Dongguan, iNexBot is a national high-tech enterprise and has applied for dozens of patents and copyrights. iNexBot's robot system has also passed ISO9001, CE and national software product certification to meet the demanding industrial field environment.

iNexBot is actively involved in the discussion and development of technical solutions for motion control industry standards. Currently, iNexBot is a member of ETG, CLPA, OPCUA and other industry associations. In the future, iNexBot will focus on the promotion and application of technologies based on TSN, 5G, IEC-61499, OPC-UA, etc.
