iNexBot is dedicated to the research and development of multi-axis motion control technology, as well as the promotion and application of industry solutions. Its core technologies include PC-based multi-axis motion control, robot kinematics, dynamics algorithms, multi-agent control, reinforcement learning, online trajectory planning, vision hand-eye calibration, 2D/3D vision, force control, and more. The company's main products currently include a general-purpose motion control software platform, motion control cards, integrated drive and control cabinets, and others. Application scenarios cover industrial robots, collaborative robots, medical surgical robots, wafer handling robots, automotive electronics, and many other fields.

The open NexDroid software platform independently developed by iNexBot provides stable, reliable, and feature-rich secondary development interfaces (NexDroid API). NexDroid separates the hardware device layer from the application layer, allowing partners to focus solely on industry needs. By leveraging the NexDroid API and combining it with industry expertise, new types of automated equipment can be developed for industries such as 3C electronics, healthcare, nuclear energy, construction machinery, wind power, and more.

iNexBot actively participates in discussions and the formulation of technical standards for the motion control industry. Currently, iNexBot is already a member of several industry associations including ETG (EtherCAT), ODVA (Ethernet/IP Profinet), CLPA, PI, and OPC-UA. In the future, iNexBot will focus on promoting and applying technologies such as TSN, 5G, IEC-61499, and OPC-UA within its areas of expertise.
